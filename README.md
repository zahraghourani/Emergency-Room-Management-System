Emergency Room Management System

## Overview
Our Emergency Room Management System is like a well-organized team with different players, each having a specific role to make sure everything runs smoothly 
in an emergency room. Here are the main players:

1. Node Class:
The Node class is the basic building block. It holds important information and helps in creating lists and queues.

2. Linked List:
The LinkedList class is a dynamic list that keeps track of patients. It helps in easily moving through the list and managing patients effectively.

3. Priority Queue:
The PriorityQueue class is the decision-maker. It figures out which patient needs urgent attention by prioritizing cases based on their urgency.

4. Emergency Room Class:
The EmergencyRoom class is the manager of the emergency room. It oversees patient flow, assigns beds, and makes sure everything is running well.

5. Patient Class:
The Patient class is like a file for each person seeking help. It contains all the necessary information to give them the right care.

6. Bed Class:
The Bed class keeps track of available beds. It helps in placing patients in the right spot and makes sure resources are used wisely.

7. ERMS Class (Emergency Room Management System):
The ERMS class is the captain of the team. It brings all the players together, making sure they work in harmony to manage the emergency room effectively.
